					<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
					<li>Blogs and social networking sites serve as a platform to the users for expressing their interests, ideas and thoughts. Targeted marketing uses the recommender systems for suggesting their services and products to the users or clients.</li>
					<li>The method used by target marketing is extraction of keywords and main topics from the user generated texts. </li>
				</section>
				
				<section data-transition="zoom-in fade-out">
					<li>Filtering is required for efficient information retrieval.</li>
					<li>For searching the documents from web search engines or extracting any useful information from documents, or social sites keywords are preferred as they assist in summarizing the concept of document.</li>
					<li>In the current era, the semantics technology is considered to be the advanced version that gives relevant results according to the queries and preferences of the users. </li>

					<h3>LITERATURE SURVEY</h3>

					<li><b>L.M. Jose et al. [1] </b> proposed a technique based on semantic graph generation on the 
					basis of user’s interest. By analyzing the content of users tweet the preferences are gathered. 
					Product based graph is also generated and by matching the user’s interest graph and product graph 
					the outcomes are predicted according to the user’s preferences. 
					</li>
					</section>

					<section data-transition="convex-in concave-out">
					<li><b>Yuezhong, et al. [2] </b> presented the technique for obtaining high quality data according to 
					user’s preferences from huge source of information.</li>
					<li><b>A. Akay et al. [3] </b> presented weighted network model and applied the technique on health 
					social network site. </li>
					<li><b>R.Nithish et al. [4] </b> proposed an approach for mining the opinions or reviews given by 
					the users about the products feature.</li>
					</section>

					<section data-transition="convex-in concave-out">
					<li><b>R. Nagarajan et al. [5] </b> presented technique for extracting the keywords by using the graph-based model comprised of nodes and edges.</li>
					<li><b>K. Selami et al. [6] </b> presented technique for semantic social recommendation system. In this approach social aspects and semantic aspects are merged by using the social network analysis measures and the semantic similarity measures.</li>

						<h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>

						<div class="fragment">
					<li>Traditional approaches do not consider the semantics of user generated texts neither they consider the users’ interest. So, it does not satisfy the accuracy of ratings and quality of the product.</li>
					<li>Conventional methods involve identifying the personal interests just on the basis of surveys and rating systems.</li>

						<h3>RESEARCH OBJECTIVES</h3>

						<div class="fragment">
							<li>To extract the user interest from the content or social sites according to their preferences, user interest models are generated. This assists in improving the accuracy in a manner that user will acquire the accurate search results, products or services.</li>
							<li>To For keyword extraction using Multi-purpose automatic topic indexing (Maui) algorithm would be beneficial in a manner that it provides the features of increase phrase length, node degree, and semantic relatedness as compared to RAKE algorithm used in baseline approach which has certain limitations of accuracy.</li>

						<div class="fragment">
							<li>Zemanta used serve as web service that also links to DBpedia. It provides more accuracy and used for data (extracted keyword tweets) analysis purpose and serves as text analysis tool too. This would be helpful in extracting the information related to user’s interest.</li>
							<li>Sentiment analysis introduce in proposed research depicts the feature in which opinion score used will determine the positive score or negative score of the product according to the user’s interest.</li>
